The repository aims to reproduce the benchmark of  the paper "A point cloud segmentation framework for image-based spatial transcriptomics".

For each benchmarked methods, examples of how to assess Jaccard index (IOU) and cell type accuracy are displayed.

Geometric shape simulation as input can be found in the folder 'simple_shape_simulation' and lung tissue simulation can be found at https://zenodo.org/records/10172316.

For MERFISH Generated Ground truth segmentation from staining as well as the result of each method can be found at https://zenodo.org/records/11067800.

This repository use the version 0.0.2 of ComSeg anf the version 0.0.46 of the pciSeq
